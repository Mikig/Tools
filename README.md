Tools for programming

First tool is Android TTS Service

This can be used to generate TTS from Unity, or other non android apps, by sending an Android intent to the service.

Intent Action:  "mit.prg.ttsservice.Speak"  for generating the intent.
Intent extras: "mit.prg.ttsservice.TextToSpeak"  for passing the text to the TTS.

Simple service, and app. Feel free to add, or change for yyour own needs.
